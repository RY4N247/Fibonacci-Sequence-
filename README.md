# Fibonacci-Sequence
A simple Ruby program to calcluate the fibonacci numbers using both iterative and recursive methods. 

### Features 
- Iterative Method: Efficiently computes Fibonacci numbers using an iterative approach.
- Recursive Method: Demonstrates the Fibonacci calculation through a recursive function.

### Usage
- Run the program.
- Choose between iterative and recursive methods.
- Enter the desired Fibonacci number.
- Get the result!

### Setup 
Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. Clone the repository and run the program.
- bash: ```ruby fibonacci.rb```
- if successful, you will be presented with a command line interface as shown below:

### Limitations 
- Iterative Method: The iterative method is generally efficient for calculating Fibonacci numbers. However, as numbers increase, the program's performance may be impacted by memory constraints.
- Recursive method: Although conceptually straightforward, may experience performance issues for larger Fibonacci numbers, leading to longer computation times.
- General Limitation: The program is optimized for calculating Fibonacci numbers within a reasonable range. Extremely large Fibonacci numbers may result in slower execution and potential inaccuracies.
